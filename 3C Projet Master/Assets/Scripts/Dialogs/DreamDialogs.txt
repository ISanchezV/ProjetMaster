Ah, I see you're lost. Do you even remember who you are?
Are you a man (left)? Or a woman (right)?
Ah, I see. At least you remember this.
And do you know how I'm talking to you? Which one is the real one here?
Yes, of course. I couldn't be anything else.
Look at this. Can you recognize the one helping you? Will you set him free?
Don't be afraid, my child. All will make sense soon. Wake up.
